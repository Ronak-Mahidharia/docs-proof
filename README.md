# docs-proof

Finds the lines in your docs that a code change made wrong, and proves each one: it runs the documented command, or it quotes the code line that contradicts the doc. It suggests a fix and changes nothing without your approval. Its accuracy is measured against an answer key built from real open-source repositories, and every result is published.

**Status:** in progress. The first step is the answer key and a baseline of exact checks, with no AI. The steps are in [docs/plan.md](docs/plan.md).

## The problem
- **Docs drift is common.** In GitHub's 2017 Open Source Survey, "incomplete or outdated documentation is a pervasive problem, observed by 93% of respondents" ([opensourcesurvey.org/2017](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/)).
- **Even in popular projects.** More than a quarter of the 1,000 most popular projects on GitHub had at least one outdated reference to code in their documentation (Tan, Wagner, and Treude, ICSME 2023: "Wait, wasn't that code here before? Detecting outdated software documentation").
- **README updates are easy to miss.** In a 2026 study of pull requests from 714 repositories, only 0.8% of all pull requests changed the README, and the study's LLM approach recovered half of the README updates that had really been made (Gao et al., [arXiv:2603.00489](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.00489)).
